shinyrouter
===========
<div class="subheader">A minimalistic router for your [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) apps.</div>

&nbsp;
-

Now it's possible to recreate a state of your app, by providing a specific URL, like 
```
make_router(
  route("<your_app_url>/main",  mainPageShinyUI),
  route("<your_app_url>/other", otherPageShinyUI)
)
```
<!--
TODO We would like to have a nice graphic explaning routing mechanism
