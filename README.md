<!-- badges: end -->

A minimalistic router for your [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) apps.

Now it's possible to recreate a state of your app, by providing a specific URL, like:

```r
  make_router(
    route("<your_app_url>/main",  mainPageShinyUI),
    route("<your_app_url>/other", otherPageShinyUI)
  )
```

<!-- TODO We would like to have a nice graphic explaning routing mechanism -->

Basic tutorial article is available on [Appsilon's blog](https://appsilon.com/shiny-router-package/).

How to contribute?

**Changes in documentation**

Documentation is rendered with `pkgdown`. Just run `pkgdown::build_site()` after editing documentation or `README.md`.

Troubleshooting
---------------

We used the latest versions of dependencies for this library, so please update your R environment before installation.

However, if you encounter any problems, try the following:

1.  Up-to-date R language environment
2.  Installing specific dependent libraries versions
    -   magrittr
            ```r
            install.packages("magrittr", version='1.5')
            ```

    -   shiny
            ```r
            install.packages("shiny", version='0.14.2.9001')
            ```

3.  Missing `shiny.semantic` dependency - one of our examples uses one of our others libraries, so please install it as well, when running that example. Repository: [shiny.semantic](https://github.com/Appsilon/shiny.semantic).

Future enhacements
