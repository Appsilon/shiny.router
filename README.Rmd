shinyrouter
===========

<div class="subheader">A minimalistic router for your [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) apps.</div>

<div class="section level2">
Now it's possible to recreate a state of your app, by providing a specific URL, like 
```
make_router(
  route("<your_app_url>/main",  mainPageShinyUI),
  route("<your_app_url>/other", otherPageShinyUI)
)
```
<!--
TODO We would like to have a nice graphic explaning routing mechanism
-->
[Live demo can be found here](http://appsilondatascience.com/demos/shinyrouter)

---------------
**Note! This library is still in its infancy. Api might change in the future.**

```

Example {.firebrick}
-------
All the exmaples can be found in /examples directory.
Here's the basic usage:
```
router <- make_router(
  route("/", root_page),
  route("/other", other_page)
)

ui <- shinyUI(semanticPage(
  title = "Router demo",
  router_ui()
))

server <- shinyServer(function(input, output) {
  router(input, output)
})

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Troubleshooting
-----------------
When developing this library we are using latest dependencies versions. So please make sure to update your R environment dependencies as well. But in case this library still doesn't work for you try to apply below suggestions:
1. Up-to-date R language environment
2. Installing specific dependent libraries versions
--* magrittr
```
install.packages("magrittr", version='1.5')
```
--* shiny
```
install.packages("shiny", version='0.14.2.9001')
```
--* shinyjs
```
install.packages("shinyjs", version='0.8')
```
3. Missing semanticui dependency
One of our examples uses one of our others libraries, so please make to install it as well, when running that example.
Repository: [Semantic UI](https://github.com/Appsilon/semanticui)

Future enhacements {.darkorange}
------------------
* URL params handling
* CRAN release
* Maybe? Utilise https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/client-data.html instead of Page.js
