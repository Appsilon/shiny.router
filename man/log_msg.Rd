\title{Helper function to print out log messages into Shiny
using \code{cat()} and \code{stderr()}, as described on
https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/debugging.html}
\usage{
log_msg(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{All params get passed through to cat().
They're automatically wrapped in shiny::isolate(),
so you can print reactive values here without too
much worry.}
}
\description{
Because this can print a lot, it's silent unless
the shiny.router.debug option is set.
